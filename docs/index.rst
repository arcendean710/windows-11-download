Methods to Download Windows 11 on Any PC 🛠️
-------------------------------------------

There are a few different ways to safely **download Windows 11 ISO** or install 
the OS directly. Here's a breakdown of the most reliable options:

Use the Installation Assistant 🧩
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Microsoft provides an official tool called the Installation Assistant. It helps 
users **upgrade to Windows 11** without needing a clean install. This is the best 
option if you're coming from Windows 10 and want to keep your files and apps.

Just run the tool, and it will automatically guide you through downloading and 
installing Windows 11, provided your PC meets the minimum requirements.

Create a Bootable USB with Media Creation Tool 💿
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a clean install or to install Windows 11 on another PC, the **Media Creation Tool** 
is the way to go. This method lets you:

- Download the **Windows 11 ISO file**
- Create a bootable USB drive
- Reinstall or upgrade your system

You can boot from the USB drive, format your drive (optional), and begin the 
fresh installation of Windows 11.

Download Windows 11 ISO File Directly 🗂️
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another safe method is downloading the **Windows 11 ISO** directly and using it 
with tools like Rufus or Windows’ own mounting tool. This method is great for those who want to:

- Create custom installations
- Install on unsupported hardware
- Keep an ISO archive for future use

Ensure the ISO file is from a verified and original source to avoid malware or tampered files.

Bypassing Hardware Requirements ⚠️
----------------------------------

If your PC is unsupported — for example, missing TPM 2.0 or Secure Boot — 
it’s still possible to **install Windows 11** using some workarounds. Some users 
use tools like Rufus or modify registry keys during installation to bypass checks.

.. warning::

   This method is not officially supported and may void support or cause issues later. 
   Proceed at your own risk and always back up your files.
